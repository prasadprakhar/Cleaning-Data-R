# Getting and Cleaning Data Project by Prakhar Prasad
Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course Coursera. 

# Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. 

# Running this script
Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to make one modification to the R file before you can process the data. Note that on line 4 of run_analysis.R, you need to set the path of the working directory to relect the location of the source files in your own directory. Check for the setwd() function and replace the path with the path of your working directory. 

# Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions
1. You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and writes it to a new file. 

# Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the Code_Book.md file.
